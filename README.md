# cystance
Generating model proteins optimised on geometry and accessibility of cysteine residues. As used in Baranovic and Plested (2018). 

buryMyCys : Generate optimised models from a user supplied seed.

native_buryMyCys : measure from user supplied models

cysTools : wrappers for CCP4 and PyMOL functions

Cystance uses:

PyMOL v2.x from Schroedinger https://pymol.org/2/

CCP4 v7.x http://www.ccp4.ac.uk

https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Main_Page

Cystance runs on a Mac. Almost certainly fails on Windows. Might work on \*nix
To get access to CCP4 the script should be run from the Terminal with CCP4 sourced.
